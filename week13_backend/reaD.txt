1.  Creating a connection pool via Prisma accelerate at the back end as the first step

2 . You have to put the actual database url from the avn or neon tech, in the .env file as DATABASE_URL 
because your cli command line prompt from the terminal will take only those database not connexion 
pool so mention the database url as the real database url, to do migration work 

3 . So you have to paste your connection poll url in the wrangler.toml file because only Wrangler
 is related to cloud flare, which compile your code so you have to put the connection pool url here as
   [vars] DATABASE_URL="connection pool url" 

4. Wranglers allows You to Store the important credentials like the database url, for suppose you can actually
 store the pool connection string in the database url in the wrangler and when you have to showcase it in the
  index.ts you can just mention the env.database then it can pull it & can understand it is a database url.
  important code in the Wrangler it is supposed to be a in wrangler because it is a runtime characteristics 
  for the cloud player 


5. Okay after completion of your migration I mean 
        npx prisma migrate dev --name  (your migration name) 

you have to get the auto generative clients and here's the catch generally we can run the command as
        npx prisma generate 

 and it will generate the automatic client for us but right now we are in a cloud flare so we have to be
 maintain the minimum size of the file so here you have to use the code as
         npx prisma generate --no-engine 

so what it will do is it can reduce the size of the modules I can say so you have to use this command if 
you are working in a cloud player probably other database society




6.  Since we have generated the clients via --no-engine method we have to instal an extension as accelerated
 which will work which will work to get the automated clients to work in a correct manner
        npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate
